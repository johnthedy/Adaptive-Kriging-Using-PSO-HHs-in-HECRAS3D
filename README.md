# Adaptive-Kriging-Using-PSO-HHs-in-HECRAS3D
Adaptive Kriging Adopting PSO with Hollow-Hypersphere space in HECRAS3D river flow reliability assessment

This code provide reliability analysis of HEC-RAS 3D model.

HEC-RAS model is not provided in this bundle but the connection code
between Kriging reliability method and HEC-RAS model using MATLAB is
provided. Original and Modified input file from HEC-RAS (ok.g03

For Kriging model, Kriging algorithm used in this study is solely taken 
from DACE toolbox Thanks to: Nielsen, H. B. (Author), Lophaven, S. N.
